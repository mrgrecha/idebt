# iDebt

I used this [guide](https://medium.com/the-react-native-log/organizing-a-react-native-project-9514dfadaa0) and this [project](https://github.com/anh2111/currency-converter) for primary structure.

### How to run project locally? ###
We use expo for developing. [Here](https://expo.io/learn) you can find how run it locally.

README will be updated soon :)
